# NinetyNine

I am attempting to solve the [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/) with Elixir. Will try to avoid `BIF`s and modules (`Enum`, `List`, `Map` etc) as much as possible

Every solution includes doctests which can be run by `mix test`
